          <ul>
        
           <li>Goal:  Get printer to fold and staple sheets so they fit in box.</li>
              <li>Called printing companies and discovered a new finisher can be added.</li>
              <li>Set up demo with salesman to make sure it does job.</li>
              <li>Followed up to make purchase order.</li>
              <li>Print finisher got purchased and installed, and I determined small booklets would be easiest.</li>
           <li>Talked with head of quality to get change approved.</li>
           <li>Made a new kit packaging diagram picture with new book</li>
           <li> Implemented change and taught operators print settings.</li>
           <li>Saved $10,000 per year after initial investment on labor and print supplies</li>
          </ul>
               <li>Boxfold Project</li>
          <ul>
        
           <li>Goal: Get boxes to be easily made/eliminate need for folder.</li>
              <li>Talked with packaging engineers to discuss better design.</li>
              <li>Decided to have supplier fold boxes beforehand, so all we need to do is break them off by perforated edges.</li>
              <li>Talked with box folding machine salesman about other boxes and set up a visit to work with mill.</li>
              <li>Get a 4-side fold model if wanted to do more models.</li>
           <li> Ran a cost analysis if worth it (labor time, other things to take into account and determined it was not the time to purchase.</li>
         
          </ul>
           <li>Torque Scale Project</li>
          <ul>
        
           <li>Goal: Find new torque scales for bottles because Torque scale is outdated and requires multiple adapters. </li>
              <li>Looked at current company and it is still old, so looked for new company online.</li>
              <li>Found one with USB and wireless capabilities.</li>
              <li>Purchased both Torbal (online one) and Sure Torque; a brand previously used. Sure Torque was a better option to connect to software and more features.</li>
              <li> Reverse engineered and developed a way to attach quick clamp system from old torque scales to new scales with no loss in accuracy. </li>
          </ul>
         <li>Tamper Seal Applicator Project</li>
          <ul>
        
           <li>Problem: Boxes were getting stuck and seals were being applied in wrong locations.</li>
              <li>Created an adjustment system so seals would be applied correctly no matter box type</li>
              <li>Developed a flexible applicator which minimized box injury as well as seal unadhesion</li>
              <li>Problem 2: Operators would ocassionally place boxes in wrong orientation</li>
              <li> Solution: implemented a color sensor to detect box orientation by picking up on specific logo signitures.</li>
            <li>Fine tuned sensor to detect the wrong orientation no matter speed or box type</li>
          </ul>

           <li>Robotic Palletizer Project</li>
          <ul>
        
           <li>Goal: Increase automation between tamper seal application to palletization of boxes. </li>
              <li>Contacted palletizer salesman to demonstrate capabilities of product</li>
              <li>Found workers oppinions to see if they would be in favor of the new automation or not</li>
              <li>Performed a cost analysis after recieving quote from salesman to see if expenditure would be worth it.</li>
              <li> Determined the robotic palletizer would be too slow and not worth the money with current market.</li>
            <li>Looked into alternative palletizing options such has sliding palletizers with cameras, but those were too expensive</li>
          </ul>
             <li>Transfer Pump Project</li>
          <ul>
        
           <li>Goal: Learn how transfer pumps work and aid in instillation </li>
              <li>Listened to the initial proposal about logistics, Reasons factored, timeline, most important features in design, contamination level, and gave ideas when the time came.</li>
            
          </ul>
            <li>Crimping Line Planning</li>
          <ul>
        
           <li>Goal: Observe and help with the planning of a new bottle cap crimping automation line. </li>
              <li>Talked with engineers about installation, paperwork, and came up with test run procedure.</li>
            
          </ul>
           <li>UV sensor Installation</li>
          <ul>
        
           <li>Goal: Determine how to stop Label detection failure if bottles were spun. </li>
              <li>Called up SICK UV sensor company and made decision that 2 sensors would be needed.</li>
            <li>Fabricated a mounting bracket and used spare sensor to get production line in working order</li>
            <li>Worked with automation engineers to modify PLC programing and complete engineering change control.</li>
          </ul>
            <li>Ethylene oxide Hopper Project</li>
          <ul>
        
           <li>Goal: Develope a way to count small cartridges that are take out of a big bag and put into a smaller bag with different quantity. </li>
              <li>Called distributor to see if they could just send big bag at small quantities and they could at a higher cost</li>
            <li>Came up with ideas of conveyor system with elevator after hopper design failed by talking with contractor about available options to incorporate counting scale.</li>
            
          </ul>
              <li>Peristaltic Pump Project</li>
          <ul>
        
           <li>Problem:  A communication error keeps occurring between the control panel and the pumps. It causes them to inject too much liquid and not stop. The emergency shutoff doesn't work as the pumps have their own "brain".</li>
              <li> Set up meeting with local pump distributor to send an engineer to talk/try to fix our pumps.</li>
            <li>Found new pump alternatives to replace old pumps and created a cost break down analysis to determine if buying new pumps made sense based on failure rate of old pummps.</li>
            </ul>

      <h2>Automation Project 1 UV Sensor Addition</h2>
<p>Fabricated a mounting bracket, ran wiring, and programmed PLC where UV sensor could detect UV coated labels on bottles and developed reject logic between sensors so if one or both detects a label, bottle may pass, but if neither do bottle is rejected.</p>

      <h2>Automation Project 2 AI camera and Color Sensor</h2>
<p>First an AI camera was tested to detect markings and blemishes on boxes and the correct orientation before being placed through a tamper evident sealer Applicator machine. Next it was determined due to one particular orientation marking that a cheaper color sensor could suffice for the orientation check. It was then purchased, mounted, calibrated, and programed into the existing PLC with a stop feature when the incorrect orientation was detected. </p>

      <h2>Automation Project 3 Tamper seal Applicator</h2>
<p>The tamper seal automation machine kept malfuntioning and would either damage boxes if its ridgid applicator bar was too snug, or not perform any seal at all if too loose. So I custom made a flexible applicator bar that reduced the incident rate to 1 out of every 1000 seals vs the 1 out of every 10 that was occuring before the addition.  </p>

      <h2>Torque Tester Upgrade and Refitment</h2>
<p>The old torque testers required very old connecting cables that were getting increasingly difficult to aquire and use. So I went about finding new torque testers to purchase. When the new ones came in, they did not have the same quick clamp system that the old ones had that the operators had grown to love. So I came up with a way to refit the quick clamp portion of the old testers onto the new testers without affecting accuracy. </p>

           <li>The focus of this course was to determine what was causing maternal mortality to be high in Georgia and develope a solution to fix the issue. </li>
        <li>This course was a semester long group project where my group determined that unchecked bleeding post giving birth was one of the major causes of maternal mortality. </li>
         
            <li>We developed a maternal diper fitted with an RFID sensor that was able to detect amounnt of blood loss based on signal strength. We then used models based on amount of blood lost over time to create a bleeding rate model that could predict if a mother was going to have a high chance of going in the danger zone. It would then alert the mother to go to the hospital. </li>

      <h2>Lactate Sensor </h2>
<p>In this project I made a working lactate sensor with the end goal of developing a continuous lactate monitor so athletes can track how much lactic acid they produce. We were able to use sensor principles to create a circuit that converted the current produced from lactate oxidase reacting with lactate similar to glucose oxidase in glucose sensors. We then used our circuit with a potentiostat and transimpedance amplifier to make a measurable voltage that varied with the amount of lactate that was added to the system. We then made a lactate calibration curve that represented how much voltage gets produced depending on the lactate concentration in the sweat.</p>

<p>This project was meant to notify mothers when they loose too much blood shortly after pregnancy. It involves a standard maternal diper with a RFID tab inserted in the diper that could detect the capacity and track how much blood is lost by the mother and notify her if it is reaching dangerous levels. Using a signal strength the RFID was able to differentiate between full empty and half full diapers. This would allow with a Reader placeed near by, consistent checks on if the mother is logging too much blood loss. </p>

<p>I developed a decentralized reveiew system using a mix of backend solidity code on the Etherium Sepolia test net and a front end UI with java script and json proceses. The review systems advantage over normal system is reviewers logs are kept and people can see who made the reviews and what they have made in the past. It also allows people searching for locations to filter based on the type of location and the system gives the location with the review sliders they chose based on ranked choice priority. It does this all while storing the reviews onto the blockchain. </p>
